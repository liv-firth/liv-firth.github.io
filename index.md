## Presentations 

`2021`
__Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing__

Conference Presentation Abstract: The state of middle school computer science (CS) has yet to be widely documented. In particular, research is needed to understand the challenges facing a diverse population of CS teachers. With the goal of learning to better support CS teachers, we have performed interviews and surveys amongst teachers throughout the country to illustrate the state of middle school CS and CS teacher self-efficacy.
